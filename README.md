### Timeline

Start Date: 1/13/2020

Finish Date: 1/19/2020 (technially not done)

Hours Spent: 24-30 hours

### Running the Program

Main class: Needs to have the Ball.java file, Brick.java file, levelChooser.java file, and the Paddle.java File

Data files needed: N/A, I wasn't able to get that far since I kept getting messed up on my code organization

Key/Mouse inputs:
* use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle

Cheat keys:
* "L" adds lives
* "R" resets the ball and paddle to initial position
* "1" sets level to level 1
* "2" sets level to level 2
* "3" sets level to level 3

Known Bugs:
* Sometimes, the ball "enters" the paddle from the sides of the paddle, which keeps the ball in play
* My losing text won't show 
* Scores aren't carried over from level to level
* Sometimes the ball gets stuck on the side and moves up, so I have to reset it by hitting the spacebar

Extra credit:
* N/A


### Notes/Assumptions
* I really struggled with the code organization and flow, which made everything much harder. I wasn't able to get as far as I would like, and couldn't include power
ups, special paddle features, reading in data files for the brick organization, and having a winning/losing screen. However, I do have a basic breakout game working, 
albeit not a very interesting one.

### Impressions
* This first project helped me realize how much I need to learn, and how much code organization is important. I kept trying to refactor the code in the beginning, but 
it slowly devolved into my just adding random lines of code hoping that it would work. I have an idea of how I should get a full game working, 
but wasn't able to implement it. I spent a lot of time on this project, only to not have a lot come out of it, but I'll take this failure as a starting point so I can 
improve in the future. I hope to be able to try to make this game at the end of the semester and see how differently (or similarly) it'll turn out. 
* I also have a long classes and lots of getters ans setters, which isn't good design. I need to reread the readings to figure out what to do about that.
